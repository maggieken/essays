This image is an oil on canvas painting by the American artist George Inness, it was done in 1870 right at the beginning of the period we are studying in this course. The painting is titled Catskill Mountains, and depicts an awe inspiring landscape, with the monumental mountains taking up most of the background space. Although these mountains are in the background, they are one of the primary focuses of the image. Along with this, there are bright shining beams of sunlight pouring down the center of the painting, directing the viewers gaze to the highest peak of the mountains in the scene. There is a vast stretch of trees and what looks like agricultural plots of land. Along with two small groups of people at the bottom of the image staring out at the landscape while the viewers do the same. The Catskill mountains were one of the biggest tourist interests in America at the time and represented a great example of the differences between urban and rural at this time in history and the debate between realism versus escapism.
